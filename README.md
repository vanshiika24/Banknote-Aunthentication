# Banknote-Authentication
A Data Science Project which uses K-Means Clustering Algorithm in Python 

This project uses a dataset that has 2 attributes i.e. Variance (V1) and Skewness (V2) of Wavelet Transformed Image of notes and performs K-Means Clustering of data points which classifies notes as forged or authentic. We visualize our data by plotting the data with the help of the pyplot interface from the matplotlib library and various other libraries in Python. By re-running the model, we observe that the cluster centers & the number of variables in each cluster are nearly the same in each run. Therefore, we can conclude that the model is stable and the K-Means algorithm can be used to detect fake banknotes.
